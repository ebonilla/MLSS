\subsubsection*{Cocktail Bars (From Sydney's Best Bar Awards 2015)}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Victoria Room: ``The Victoria Room is the real deal, combining craft cocktails, incredible bartender knowledge and a beautiful venue.''
\item Eau de Vie: ``This speakeasy-style bar has a wealth of talented bartenders working with exceptional hooch. It’s an industry haunt, a den of iniquity, and probably the best fun you can have with a glass in your hand.''
\item Low 302: ``The Crown Street stalwart has been delivering on the cocktail front since ’09 and they’re showing no signs of slowing down. You might go for a beer (and many do) but you’d be mad not to stay for a Gimlet.''
\item Rockpool Bar and Grill: ``If there’s one place in Sydney you’re guaranteed to get a great drink and a great snack, it’s here. Bartenders make their own sodas and syrups and can rustle up a tasty drink faster than you can say Julep''
\item Shady Pines: ``They’ll pour you a beer as fast as they pour a Sazerac and all with the same level of attention and care. If you haven’t had them make you a Negroni topped with Coke (blasphemous!) then you haven’t truly lived.''
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{What to Do}
Within easy access of the University:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Aquarium
\item Wildlife World (see some kangaroos and wallabies!!)
\item Opera House
\item Bridge climb
\item Ferry to Manly Beach
\item Coogee Beach
\item Bondi Beach
\end{itemize}

Further afield:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Hunter Valley (great wine)
\item The Blue Mountains (stunning scenery)
\item Jervis Bay (South) and Nelson Bay (North) (see some dolphins!!)
\item The Great Barrier Reef is a half day flight away
\item Uluru (a large sandstone rock formation in central Australia) 
\end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Location}

% \section*{Dinner/Bars}
% 
% Los Angeles downtown is just a few miles away from the USC campus and
% can be conveniently reached by bus or taxi. We particularly recommend
% L.A. Live which is right next to the Staples Center. It is a few
% minutes from the USC campus by bus or taxi, is spectacular at night
% and offers a lot of restaurants and bars. Los Angeles downtown is
% fairly safe, however for your own safety please try to avoid walking
% alone through the streets after midnight. Bars in Los Angeles downtown
% close at 2:00.

% \section*{About Los Angeles}
% 
% Los Angeles also nicknamed the {\it City of Angels} is the most
% populous city in California with a population of 3.8 million and the
% second most populous in the United States. With a metropolitan
% population of over 15 million people it is also one of the largest in
% the world and the second after New York in the United States.\\
% 
% Los Angeles itself was founded 1781 by a Spanish governor and became
% part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In
% 1848, at the end of the Mexican-American War, Los Angeles and the rest
% of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe
% Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Today Los Angeles
% is one of the most multicultural counties in the United States, while
% the entire Los Angeles area itself is recognized and regarded as the
% most diverse metropolitan area in the United States.\\
% 
% Los Angeles is a city of diverse cultures and many are showcased in or
% around downtown. The area's highlights include Grand Central Market,
% MOCA, Disney Concert Hall, The Music Center, Olvera Street, Chinatown,
% Little Tokyo, the Natural History Museum, and the Japanese-American
% Museum. Downtown is also home to some of the most unique and stunning
% examples of American and international architecture. No trip to Los
% Angeles is complete without a visit to its most famous district:
% Hollywood, best known as the self-declared entertainment capital of
% the world. The core of Hollywood for a tourist is its three
% fascinating boulevards: Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, and
% Melrose Avenue. All three are worth seeing. Hollywood Blvd. is known
% for its entertainment history; Sunset Blvd. for its clubs and
% nightlife; and Melrose Ave. for its dining, shopping, nightlife, and
% eclecticism.\\
% 
% Los Angeles enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an
% average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually. 
% During the conference period the historial average daytime high 
% temperature is 82 $^{\circ}$F (28 $^{\circ}$C) and the average 
% nighttime low temperature is 63
% $^{\circ}$F (17 $^{\circ}$C).
